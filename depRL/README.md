### Big update!

We now provide code for our newest preprint, [Natural and Robust Walking using Reinforcement Learning without Demonstrations in High-Dimensional Musculoskeletal Models](https://sites.google.com/view/naturalwalkingrl). With this work, we take a step towards _natural_ movement generation with RL.
This update provides code for adaptive energy costs in muscle-driven systems and provides support for the SCONE and Hyfydy softwares in the shape of the recently released [sconegym](https://github.com/tgeijten/sconegym/tree/main) environment suite.

The new features also include pre-trained baselines from the preprint, enabling rendering from SCONE and much more. See the [docs](https://deprl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for more information.

We encourage anyone encountering bugs or wanting help to open a GitHub issue or contact us directly. Let us help you make it work.

## Abstract
Muscle-actuated organisms are capable of learning an unparalleled diversity of
dexterous movements despite their vast amount of muscles. Reinforcement learning (RL) on large musculoskeletal models, however, has not been able to show
similar performance. We conjecture that ineffective exploration in large overactuated action spaces is a key problem. This is supported by our finding that common
exploration noise strategies are inadequate in synthetic examples of overactuated
systems. We identify differential extrinsic plasticity (DEP), a method from the
domain of self-organization, as being able to induce state-space covering exploration within seconds of interaction. By integrating DEP into RL, we achieve fast
learning of reaching and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems, outperforming
current approaches in all considered tasks in sample efficiency and robustness.


## Installation

We provide a python package for easy installation:
```
pip install deprl
```

There are more instructions on installation from source, and other things, in the [documentation](https://deprl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

### Environments
The ICLR publication includes experiments with human arms:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/P-Schumacher/warmup.git
```
and a bipedal ostrich. The OstrichRL environment can be installed from [here](https://github.com/vittorione94/ostrichrl).

We also collaborated with groups that provide musculoskeletal control environments and provide additional baselines as well as code from our latest preprints.

### Hyfydy and sconegym
We include several pre-trained baselines and configuration files to train the policies from our newest [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02976). These allow you to train walking agents in [Hyfydy](hyfydy.com) with RL for natural walking and robust running tasks. We worked together with Thomas Geijtenbeek [@tgeijten](https://github.com/tgeijten) to create a python environment interface for Hyfydy, called [sconegym](https://github.com/tgeijten/sconegym/tree/main)!
This repository also includes the definitions of all the cost terms we used, see [here](https://github.com/tgeijten/sconegym/blob/main/sconegym/gaitgym.py).
The configuration files to train our sconegym policies are included [here](https://github.com/martius-lab/depRL/tree/main/experiments/hyfydy).


Check out how to install sconegym from their [repo](https://github.com/tgeijten/sconegym/blob/main/sconegym/gaitgym.py), you can immediately start with a simple OpenSim model. To access the fast Hyfydy engine, and the complex 3D models, you need to request a trial license from the [Hyfydy](hyfydy.com) website or purchase a license. Some usage examples can be found [here](https://deprl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hyfydy_baselines.html) and [here]()

### MyoLeg
If you are coming here for the MyoLeg, take a look at this [tutorial](https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/blob/main/docs/source/tutorials.rst#load-dep-rl-baseline). It will show you how to run the pre-trained baseline. We also explain how to train the walking agent in the MyoSuite  [documentation](https://myosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/baselines.html#dep-rl-baseline).

</p>

This repository has been updated with training files that have been used for the MyoSuite baselines, as well as pretrained networks.
Simply try training something:

`python -m deprl.main experiments/myosuite_training_files/myoChaseTag.json`

or render the pretrained baselines with:

`python experiments/myosuite_training_files/render_baselines.py`

You have to find your own reward function, of course. These files also require the installation of `myosuite==2.1.5`.

We will release a tutorial on how to implement all cost terms from our natural walking [preprint](https://sites.google.com/view/naturalwalkingrl) in the near future.


## Experiments

The major experiments (humanreacher reaching and ostrich running) can be repeated with the config files.
Simply run from the root folder:
```
python -m deprl.main experiments/ostrich_running_dep.json
python -m deprl.main experiments/humanreacher.json
```
to train an agent. Model checkpoints will be saved in the `output` directory.
The progress can be monitored with:
```
python -m tonic.plot --path output/folder/
```

To execute a trained policy, use:

```
python -m deprl.play --path output/folder/
```

See the [TonicRL](https://github.com/fabiopardo/tonic) documentation for details.

Be aware that ostrich training can be seed-dependant, as seen in the plots of the original publication.

## Pure DEP
If you want to see pure DEP in action, just run the following bash files after installing the ostrichrl and warmup environments.
```
bash play_files/play_dep_humanreacher.sh
bash play_files/play_dep_ostrich.sh
bash play_files/play_dep_dmcontrol_quadruped.sh
```

You might see a more interesting ostrich behavior by disabling episode resets in the ostrich environment first.
## Environments

The ostrich environment can be found [here](https://github.com/vittorione94/ostrichrl) and is installed automatically via poetry.

The arm-environment [warmup](https://github.com/P-Schumacher/warmup) is also automatically installed by poetry and can be used like any other gym environment:

```
import gym
import warmup

env = gym.make("humanreacher-v0")

for ep in range(5):
     ep_steps = 0
     state = env.reset()
     while True:
         next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
         env.render()
         if done or (ep_steps >= env.max_episode_steps):
             break
         ep_steps += 1

```

The humanoid environments were simulated with [SCONE](https://scone.software/doku.php?id=start). A ready-to-use RL package will be released in cooperation with GOATSTREAM at a later date.

## Source Code Installation
We recommend an installation with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to ensure reproducibility.
While [TonicRL](https://github.com/fabiopardo/tonic) with PyTorch is used for the RL algorithms, DEP itself is implemented in `jax`. We *strongly* recommend GPU-usage to speed up the computation of DEP. On systems without GPUs, give the tensorflow version of TonicRL a try! We also provide a requirements file for pip. Please check the instructions for GPU and CPU versions of `torch` and `jax` above.

### Pip
Just clone the repository and install locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/martius-lab/depRL.git
cd depRL
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./
```

### Poetry

1. Make sure to install poetry and deactivate all virtual environments.
2. Clone the environment
```
git clone https://github.com/martius-lab/depRL
```

3. Go to the root folder and run
```
poetry install
poetry shell
```

That's it!

The build has been tested with:
```
Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04
CUDA 12.0
poetry 1.4.0
```

### Troubleshooting
* A common error with poetry is a faulty interaction with the python keyring, resulting in a `Failed to unlock the collection!`-error. It could also happen that the dependency solving takes very long (more than 60s), this is caused by the same error.
  If it happens, try to append
```
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
```
to your bashrc. You can also try to prepend it to the poetry command: `PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring poetry install`.
* If you have an error related to your `ptxas` version, this means that your cuda environment is not setup correctly and you should install the cuda-toolkit. The easiest way is to do this via conda if you don't have admin rights on your workstation.
  I recommend running
```
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit-dev
```
* In any other case, first try to delete the `poetry.lock` file and the virtual env `.venv`, then run `poetry install` again.


Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems.
